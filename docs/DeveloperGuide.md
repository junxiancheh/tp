### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-s A1234567A`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete-s A1234567A")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-s A1234567A` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram.png](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student Feature

#### Overview
The Add Student command allows Facility Manager to record a new student profile in the database by specifying their name, matriculation number, phone number, and email. It is facilitated by `AddStudentCommand` and its corresponding parser `AddStudentCommandParser`.

#### Implementation Details
The implementation follows the **Command Pattern**, involving the following key components:

* `AddStudentCommandParser`: Responsible for parsing the user input and validating the presence of required prefixes.
* `AddStudentCommand`: Contains the execution logic, ensuring the student is unique before addition.
* `Person`: The entity that encapsulates student data (`Name`, `StudentId`, `Phone`, and `Email`).

#### Design Considerations
One of the noteworthy details in the implementation is the Defensive Validation in the execution stage:

**Parsing Stage**: The parser uses an `arePrefixesPresent` method to ensure that all mandatory prefixes (`n/`, `m/`, `p/`, and `e/`) are present and of the correct data format. If any are missing or if there is an invalid preamble, a `ParseException` is thrown.

**Execution Stage**: Performs a check against the existing database to prevent duplicate entries based on Student ID, Phone, or Email.

#### Execution Workflow
1. The Facility Manager enters a command as such:
`add-s n/John Doe m/A0123456B p/91234567 e/e0123456@u.nus.edu`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`.
3. An `AddStudentCommandParser` is instantiated to tokenize the arguments. The parser uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to verify that all required prefixes (`n/`, `m/`, `p/`, `e/`) are present.
4. A `Person` object is created and wrapped inside a new `AddStudentCommand`.
5. The `LogicManager` calls `AddStudentCommand#execute()`.
6. The `Model` is checked for existing students with the same identity (e.g., same Matric Number, phone number, email).
7. If unique, the `Model` is updated, and a `CommandResult` is returned to the UI.

![AddStudentDiagram](images/AddStudentDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> **Note**: The lifeline for AddStudentCommand should technically end with a destruction marker (X) immediately after it returns the CommandResult. Due to the layout engine limitations of PlantUML, the lifeline may appear to continue to the bottom of the diagram, but the object is functionally disposed of after execution.
</div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete-s 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete-s` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete-s 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add-s n/David …​` to add a new student. The `add-s` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add-s n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-s`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Technical and Environmental Requirements**

1.  The system should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, provided that Java 17 is installed on the OS.
2.  The application should be distributed in a single JAR file.

**Performance and Scalability**
1.  The system must be able to handle at least 1,000 equipment items, 50 rooms, and 2,000 student profiles without any perceptible lag in command execution.
2.  The system should be handle to multiple rapid commands during peak period (etc 1 command every 2 seconds)

**Reliability & Data Integrity**
1.   All data (equipment, rooms, students, and loans) must be saved to the local storage immediately after any state-changing command is executed for persistency.
2.   If the application is closed unexpectedly, the data file must remain uncorrupted and readable upon the next launch.


### Glossary
* **AddressBook**: The internal data store that holds all student, equipment, and room records. Inherited from the AB3 base project.
* **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A defined contract (typically a Java interface) through which one software component exposes its functionality to other components.
* **Equipment** : Any item that is being loaned out for the school, saved as a string, with spaces replaced as hyphens.<br>
   Example: `Wilson-Evolution-Basketball`
* **Room** : Any facility or venue that is being reserved, saved as a string, with spaces replaced as hyphens.<br>
   Example: `MPSH-1`
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Matric Number (StudentId)**: A unique NUS matriculation number assigned to each student (e.g. `A0123456B`). Used as the primary identifier for student records. Must follow the format: letter, 7 digits, letter.
* **MSS (Main Success Scenario)**: The primary, happy-path sequence of steps in a use case describing how the system behaves when everything goes as expected.
* **Student (Person)**: An individual registered in the system, uniquely identified by their matric number, phone number and email address. They are the primary actors for borrowing equipment and booking rooms.

   3. Test case: `filter-e nonexistent`<br>
      Expected: No equipment are displayed. Message indicates 0 equipment listed.

   4. Other incorrect filter commands to try: `filter IHG`, `filter-e invalid tag` (with space)<br>
      Expected: Error message showing invalid command format or invalid flag/tag name.

3. Clearing filters

   1. Prerequisites: A filter is currently active (e.g., `filter-e maintenance` was executed).

   2. Test case: `list-r` (for rooms) or `list-e` (for equipment)<br>
      Expected: All rooms/equipment are displayed again. Filter is cleared and full list is shown.


### Help command

1. Showing the general help message

   1. Test case: `help`<br>
      Expected: General help message is displayed, listing available commands and command scope notes.

2. Showing help for a specific command

   1. Test case: `help reserve`<br>
      Expected: Success message shown for the `RESERVE` command, followed by the detailed usage format for `reserve`.

   2. Test case: `help issue`<br>
      Expected: Success message shown for the `ISSUE` command, followed by the detailed usage format for `issue`.

3. Showing help for an unknown command

   1. Test case: `help helpplease`<br>
      Expected: Failure message states that the command was not found.

4. Extra input handling


  1. Test case: `help reserve extra`<br>
     Expected: Since the parser passes the whole remaining input as a topic, the system treats `reserve extra` as
      one command topic and shows a command not found failure message.



## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**


1. Support multiple reservations for the same room or equipment, as long as the booking periods do not overlap. In the 
current system, once an equipment/room is reserved, its status is immediately changed to Booked which prevent it from 
being reserved/issued even when there is no time conflict

2. Enforce time check for reservations. Currently, users are able to reserve items for unrealistic dates far into the 
future, such as the year 2099. Also, extremely long reservation period is allowed. To prevent this, we will introduce a 
booking window that only allows reservations within a reasonable time range. Also, overdue reservations for room does 
not automatically clear. In future iterations, a time check will be applied so overdue room reservations will be removed 
automatically. Currently, time check is done by Java’s default resolver, which can accept invalid dates like 2027-02-30 
and normalise them into the nearest valid date.

3. Alias of rooms and equipment will be available on the UI. 


### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data files
   1. Prerequisites: Ensure addressbook.json does not exist in the `/data` folder.
   2. Test case: Launch the app.<br>
      Expected: App launches with default sample data. A new addressbook.json is created in the `/data` folder.

2. Dealing with corrupted data files
   1. Prerequisites: Open `addressbook.json` in a text editor and delete a required brace `{` or change a field name to an invalid string.
   2. Test case: Launch the app.<br>
      Expected: App launches with an empty list (0 students, 0 equipment, 0 rooms). An error log is generated.
