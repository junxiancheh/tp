TrackMasterPro (TMP) is a **desktop management solution** tailored for **Facility Managers** who handle high-volume bookings and equipment tracking for CCAs, Clubs, and Halls. While it features a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI), it is optimized for those who prefer the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI).

During high-pressure periods such as the Inter-Hall Games (IHG), Inter-College Games (ICG), or intensive CCA training seasons, clicking through menus is too slow. If you are a fast typer, TrackMasterPro allows you to manage logistical chaos faster than any traditional mouse-based application.

   5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `add-s n/John Doe m/A0123456B p/91234567 e/e0123456@u.nus.edu` : Adds a new student with the name `John Doe`, matric number `A0123456B`, phone number `91234567` and email address `e0123456@u.nus.edu`.

## 2. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-s n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John-Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John-Doe t/friend` or as `n/John-Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

* Creates a reservation for the specified item or room under the specified student.

* If the specified item or room is already reserved for the requested time period, the command will be rejected.

Examples:
* `reserve Hall-2 a1234567a f/2026-03-01 1400 t/2026-03-01 1600`
* `reserve MPSH-1 a1234567a f/2026-03-10 0900 t/2026-03-10 1200`

![reserve command screenshot](images/reserveCommand.png)

**Failure**
`Error: Wilson-Evolution-Basketball-1 is not currently issued.`


#### Issuing an equipment item: `issue`

Issues an equipment item to a student with a due date and time for return.

Format: `issue ITEM_ID STUDENT_ID DUE_DATE_TIME`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use this command to keep track of borrowed equipment and who is responsible for returning it.
</div>

* Issues the specified equipment item to the specified student.
* The due date/time must be in the future and follow the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.
* The command will be rejected if the item is already issued to another student.

Duplicate handling:
* If the item is already issued, the system will reject the command.
* The system will show the current holder of the item and its due date/time.

Examples:
* `issue Wilson-Evolution-Basketball-1 A1203763K 2026-03-05 1700`

**Notes**
- aliases are supported, so if `b1` is an alias for `Wilson-Evolution-Basketball-1`, then `return b1` also works


#### Creating an alias: `alias`

Creates a short alias for an equipment item or room.

Format: `alias ITEM_OR_ROOM_ID ALIAS_NAME`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Aliases are useful for long item or room IDs, especially during busy periods when faster command entry is helpful.
</div>

## 3. Data Management

### Automatic Saving

TrackMasterPro data is saved in the local storage automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Manual Data Editing

TrackMasterPro data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TrackMasterPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TrackMasterPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TrackMasterPro home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
