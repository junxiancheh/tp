TrackMasterPro (TMP) is a **desktop management solution** tailored for **Facility Managers** who handle high-volume bookings and equipment tracking for CCAs, Clubs, and Halls. While it features a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI), it is optimized for those who prefer the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI).

During high-pressure periods such as the Inter-Hall Games (IHG), Inter-College Games (ICG), or intensive CCA training seasons, clicking through menus is too slow. If you are a fast typer, TrackMasterPro allows you to manage logistical chaos faster than any traditional mouse-based application.

## 2. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g., in `add-s n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-s n/John-Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John-Doe t/friend` or as `n/John-Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., `[t/TAG]…` can be used as many times (i.e. 0 times), `t/ICG`, `t/IFG t/CareerFest` etc.

* Parameters with prefixes can be in any order(eg. n/,p/).<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Each alias must be unique across the system.
* Only works for reservation , issue, cancel, return commands.

**Duplicate handling:**
* Duplicate aliases are not allowed.
* If the alias is already in use, the command will be rejected.

**Examples:**
* `alias MPSH-1 hall1`

**Outputs:**

* Success <br>
![alias command screenshot](images/aliasCommand.png)

* Failure <br>
![failed alias command screenshot](images/faliedAliasCommand.png)

## 3. Data Management
### Automatic Saving

TrackMasterPro data is saved in the local storage automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Manual Data Editing

TrackMasterPro data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TrackMasterPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TrackMasterPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TrackMasterPro home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

3. **Strict Name Validation:** The current system only accepts alphabetic characters and spaces for student names. Names containing special characters such as hyphens (e.g., `Al-Haddad`) or apostrophes (e.g., `D'Souza`) will currently trigger a validation error.
**Workaround**: Enter the name without the special character (e.g., `Al Haddad` or `DSouza`) until a future update expands the character support. Removing special characters from the requirements allows for faster command entry and fewer parsing errors during high-pressure facility management scenarios

4. **UI Refresh Latency:** The student list does not refresh in real-time when a reservation or equipment loan becomes overdue. While the system correctly identifies the status change in the database, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) may still show the old status (e.g., "Booked" instead of "Overdue").
**Workaround:*** Simply click anywhere within the application window to force the UI to refresh and display the most current statuses.
